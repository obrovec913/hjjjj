MERRIES products will not only provide an exceptional feeling of comfort when the baby is moving and exploring the environment, but will also be suitable for babies with allergies to regular diapers.\nMerries pants diapers are a great choice for an active, naughty baby. Unmatched air permeability is a key advantage of Merries pants diapers. The inside of the diapers is made of light, soft, wavy material*, which ensures air permeability, so the baby’s butt will not overheat, so it will protect against unpleasant skin irritation. Heat around the waist is released directly through the gap between the waist gathers and baby’s skin.\n*Only M size\n"
